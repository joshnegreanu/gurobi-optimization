0,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
0,@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
0,@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
0,@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
0,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail

0,@AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
0,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
0,@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.

0,@united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a.
0,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
0,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.

0,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
0,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
0,@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault

0,@AmericanAir but seriously if my cats dead I'm going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul

0,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
0,@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.

1,@USAirways  thank you! Glad to be heading home! Great people at your call center!

1,"@americanair Greatest Newark Gate Agents ever: David Deane, Norma Sedholm and Luz Calderon just made me feel like a king. #AmericanAirlines"

0,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
1,@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife

0,"@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?"

0,@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
0,"@SouthwestAir yeah, all 4 are rebooked for tomorrow AM. Hoping the 3rd time is a charm for no Cancelled Flightled flights!"

0,@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
0,@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
0,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
0,@USAirways can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger.
0,"@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!"
0,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
1,@AmericanAir Thanks so much!

0,@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
0,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
0,@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
0,@USAirways Three hour delay from Miami to London.  None of the other flights today are delayed. Put me on another flight!

1,@AmericanAir I can hardly believe it! Bundle up and stay warm! 😉
0,@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons
1,@AmericanAir no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!! #sna2ord #1644
0,@AmericanAir @ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
1,@united did I win :)
0,"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain"

1,"@VirginAmerica @freddieawards Done and done! Best airline around, hands down!"
1,@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
0,@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
0,@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
0,@SouthwestAir well I'm not sure what there is you can do.  The bad experience had already been had
0,@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
1,@JetBlue I was so excited when I saw that you fly there! #ionlyflyblue
0,@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
0,@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min 😥 #fail
0,"@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS."
0,@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
0,@AmericanAir Fuck you.
0,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
0,@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
0,@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
0,@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
0,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
1,@JetBlue thank you!! Miss you all so so much!! Is this the link to the blog? Or has that changed?
0,@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
1,@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
0,@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned."
0,@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
1,@JetBlue is the greatest airline ever 💕✈️💺 #TrueBluePoints #jetbluemember
0,@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
0,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
0,@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
0,@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
0,"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
0,“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
0,@AmericanAir im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
1,@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
0,@united that's cool - now what?
0,@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
0,@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
0,@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
0,@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
1,@USAirways thanks.
0,"@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail"
0,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
0,@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
0,@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
0,"@USAirways husband tried to use dividends &amp; companion fair for emergency, transferred &amp; put on hold for over two hours gave up #disappointed"
0,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
0,"@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail"
0,"@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less"
0,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
0,@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID"
0,@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
0,@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
0,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
1,"@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!"
0,@AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
1,@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure.
0,@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
1,@VirginAmerica thank you! See y'all soon! I'm excited to see the expansion of destinations. Spread those wings!
0,@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay
0,@USAirways it takes a month?
0,@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡
0,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
0,@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
0,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
1,@JetBlue the best airline in the world
1,@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
0,@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
0,@SouthwestAir Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.
0,@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
0,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC."
0,@JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
1,@JetBlue Seems very likely.
0,@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
0,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
0,@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
0,@united delayed another hour
0,@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
1,@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!

0,@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
0,"@USAirways epic fail @ CLT ystrdy w/Cancelled Flightled flights. No staff, no communication &amp; no refund for unused portion of tix. Keep it classy guys"
0,@USAirways here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted
0,"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
0,@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
0,@SouthwestAir @ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
1,"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
1,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
0,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
1,@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
0,"@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!"
1,@VirginAmerica just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome
0,"@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
0,"@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain"
0,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0,@SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
0,@JetBlue your wifi is a lie and i hate you
0,@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
0,@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
0,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
0,@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
0,@JetBlue your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too
1,@JetBlue well lucky I only fly JB..I guess I would be even more squished on any other airline 😞
0,@SouthwestAir I thought you guys were the best airline...I've been on hold for an hour!
0,"@USAirways on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. @AmericanAir answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet."
0,@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
0,@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
0,@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
0,@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
0,"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"
0,@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
0,"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
0,@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
0,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
1,@SouthwestAir thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir
0,@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
0,@JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry!
0,@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
0,@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours
1,@united flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!
0,@JetBlue all day
1,@SouthwestAir show me some love and a companion flight~please and thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
0,"@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss."
0,@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
0,@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
0,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0,"@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. 

#filmjobnoequipment

0,"@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you."
0,"@SouthwestAir He is going to file a formal complaint, this should have never happened. Please direct us to the right department."
0,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
0,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
1,@SouthwestAir amazing service by your SW stewardesses! From den to Cun and from CUN to Atl and atl to lax. Thank u!
0,@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
1,@SouthwestAir thank you!!
0,.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
1,@USAirways your team member at DCA- Tamara R. is her name was awesome. You should have more employees like her!
1,@SouthwestAir Fantastic! Thank you!
0,"@JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw."
0,@SouthwestAir  no such thing as a free flight. Gonna be spending $100 on board rental bc #swa couldn't get my baggage to greenville w me.
0,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0,"@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign."
1,@VirginAmerica happy to spend the day together. Let's do this!
0,"@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles"
1,@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
1,@SouthwestAir I changed my flight through St. Louis. Thanks for the reply though!
0,@SouthwestAir every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?
0,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
0,@SouthwestAir grouchy about this flight 636 #complimentarybeveragesneeded
0,@JetBlue the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It's staticy #ithelpsabit
0,@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
0,@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
0,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
0,@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
0,@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
0,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
0,"@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail"
0,@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
0,@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
0,"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
0,"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
0,@JetBlue Flight is 100% full.
1,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
1,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
0,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
0,@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
0,@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple

0,"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
0,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
0,@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
0,"@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything."
0,@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
0,"@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone."
0,@USAirways 2 hours?! And just got disconnected.

0,"@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where..."
0,@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
0,"@USAirways Never heard back, but this would help: Any chance I could bump up my flight time closer to 3pm today? I'm on flight 3960."
0,"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."

0,@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
0,@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
0,@SouthwestAir Flight 3336 - why do multiple tracking sites have more up to date info than SWA's app and website?
0,@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
1,@JetBlue i love this song &lt;3 thanks @JetBlue

1,Thanks @SouthwestAir ! #heartlanta
0,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
0,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
0,@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
0,Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
0,@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
0,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
0,"@AmericanAir I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable."
1,@VirginAmerica loved it. Can't wait for Monday's return flight... Mostly just to watch the inflight safety video again. #sorrynotsorry
0,@SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?
1,@JetBlue Thank you for the service credit. And to @PamGrout for positive thoughts.
0,@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
0,@USAirways -- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call.
1,@SouthwestAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-

0,"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm."
1,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
0,@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
0,@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
0,@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
1,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
1,@VirginAmerica thanks for gate checking my baggage on your full flight dfw-lax 883 and giving me early boarding too #sweet
0,@AmericanAir from a service rep but that hasn't happened yet. I'm honestly fed up and sick of this. No notice when my flight got Cancelled Flighted
0,@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
0,@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
0,"@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins"
0,@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
0,@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
0,"@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed"

0,@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
0,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
0,@JetBlue please provide me your direct email for me to explain.
0,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
0,"@USAirways stuck on the ramp at DCA, US Air computer system crashed...everywhere."
0,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
0,@USAirways no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways

0,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
0,"@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue"
0,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
0,@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
0,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
0,@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
0,@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.
1,@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
1,@JetBlue okay thank you! I'll check with them again!
1,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
0,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
1,"“@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!” Yup! New beanie http://t.co/AnEqXZR4bp"
0,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
0,"@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!"
0,@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
0,@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
1,@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ☕✈👍

1,@SouthwestAir Thanks Lindsey &amp; the Southwest twitter team for great service &amp; a speedy resolution #LuvAgent #swa
0,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
0,"@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers."
0,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
0,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
0,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show

0,@United Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help.
0,"@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT."
0,"@USAirways 24 hrs Late Flightr still not home. Hotel, rental car etc with a 5 yr old, what happened to ""customer service is our first priority"""
0,"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
0,"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
0,@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
1,"@SouthwestAir ""Airport snow removal method #22..""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/7poFSXOjSY"
0,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
1,@SouthwestAir got mine!  Just in time for the wife and my 15th anniversary!
0,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."
0,@SouthwestAir How to I rebook on-line when it keeps telling me that it's a reserv number for a past date (this morning)? Holding for 2hrs.
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924
0,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
0,@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
0,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
0,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
0,@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
0,@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
0,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
0,@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
0,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
0,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."

1,@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!
0,@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
0,@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
0,"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
0,@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
0,@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
0,@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
0,@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
0,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
0,@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do
0,@united 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown
0,@USAirways this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me.
0,@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal

0,@USAirways i will be on this plane while on the ground longer than i will be in the air. US5235

1,"@AmericanAir $90 dollar RT ticket to Chicago? Yes, Please!"
1,"@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}"
0,@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.
0,"@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate."
0,"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever."

0,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
0,@USAirways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1
0,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
0,"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
0,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
0,"@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?"
0,@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
0,@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
1,@united DM sent.  Thanks.
0,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly"
0,@AmericanAir flight was Cancelled Flightled can you guys help?
0,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
1,@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it’s hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
0,@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
0,@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.

1,@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
0,@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
0,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
1,@AmericanAir Always enjoy my time. Now on the plane to DFW!
1,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
0,@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
0,@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
0,@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
0,@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
0,@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
0,"@JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3)"
0,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0,"@USAirways, another hour gone &amp; they sit with more snow on them! Seriously?! http://t.co/Fupf0UAyir"
0,"@JetBlue 
But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service."
0,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
0,@VirginAmerica What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail
0,@united customer service 👎
1,@SouthwestAir just sent another 4 drink coupons....I think I have over 30 coupons now. free drinks anyone?
1,@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
0,"@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.."
0,"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
0,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
0,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
0,"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
0,"@AmericanAir You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do"
1,@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
0,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
0,@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
0,"@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp"
1,@SouthwestAir they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood
0,"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
0,"@united That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal."
0,@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again
0,"@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love..."
0,"@SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!"
1,@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
0,@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
0,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
0,".@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"
0,@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
0,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""
0,@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
0,@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
0,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0,"@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns."
0,"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
1,@southwestair cool shot of the moon and one of your fleet http://t.co/kl9BAiMES6
1,@SouthwestAir never lets me down!!!
0,@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
1,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
0,@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
0,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
0,@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
1,@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
1,"@USAirways I finally spoke to a person. Despite the mind boggling wait time, the rep was very pleasant and very helpful. Kudos to her."
0,@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
0,@SouthwestAir FJBFSC  all I need is receipt showing the 776.20 charge I have on my Amex not the 656.xx that I keep getting sent
0,"@usairways I don't understand why I can't get my missing miles? I was on the flight, it was in my Dividend Miles Account… #help"
0,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
0,@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
1,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
1,@JetBlue Thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
0,@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
0,"@JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail"
0,@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
0,"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
1,@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
0,@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
1,@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
0,@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
1,"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
0,@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
0,@SouthwestAir very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flights😔 I should've flew @Delta
0,"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
0,@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
1,"That would be great! I never thought I'd be the sort who'd be into them, but it really makes the flying experience more bearable @JetBlue"
1,@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.
0,@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
0,@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
0,"@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ"
1,@JetBlue thanks...
0,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
1,@SouthwestAir yes please!
0,@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
0,"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
0,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
0,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
0,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
0,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
0,"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
1,@SouthwestAir Landed in Nashville! Thanks for taking care of us! http://t.co/RYXbPLgMnK
0,@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it
0,@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
0,"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
0,@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
0,"@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher..."
0,@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW
0,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
0,"@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country."
0,@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
1,"@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!"
0,@AmericanAir I've been doing this all night. Can someone please help? I need my flt fixed. Please???
1,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ♥
0,@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
0,@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS.
1,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
0,"@SouthwestAir VERY frustrated. Saw seats avail. online for pref alt. flight, unable to book online, lost those seats during &gt;2 hr phone hold"

0,@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip
0,"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎"
0,@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
0,"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"
0,@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
1,@SouthwestAir I love you guys! Had to take a few other airlines this week...makes me love and appreciate y'all so much more! #onlywaytofly
0,"@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!"
0,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
1,@USAirways how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink
1,@JetBlue thank you! I know the weather in #Boston isn't great. Everyone's tired
0,@JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided
0,@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
0,"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
0,"@usairways I've been on hold since 11:30pm how many customer service reps do you have?
 #seriously"
1,@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)

0,@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
0,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy

0,@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
0,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?"
0,@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this

0,"@USAirways - what a disaster! Flight 3739, missed passenger count by 5 since it was done manually!!  Really???"
0,@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
1,@VirginAmerica I've applied more then once to be a member of the #inflight crew team...Im 100% interested. #flightattendant #dreampath -G
0,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
0,@SouthwestAir @BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund
0,@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
0,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
0,@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
0,"@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed."
0,@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
0,@united do you guys have any working planes?
0,@SouthwestAir @PoteetTJ had to fly @Delta MCO-&gt;CMH for $400 b/c we cldnt reach SWA to reroute SWA 3104 Cancelled Flightlation. Voucher wld help.

0,"@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting"
0,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
0,@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
0,@SouthwestAir You need to be more accommodating to your loyal customers. Not happy now!
0,@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
0,@SouthwestAir when will airfare be available through December of this year? I have 2 major trips coming up and I'm anxious to book them!
0,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
0,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
0,.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
1,@united thnx
0,@SouthwestAir is there any estimate on when the holding for you online will end? I'm at an hour and forty minutes now. I need to rebook!!!

0,@SouthwestAir Roger wilco.
0,.@SouthwestAir thx for the note. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and today is all booked so had to go with another carrier. :(
0,@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
0,@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
0,@SouthwestAir you're killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh

0,@AmericanAir I would purchase it if I was there by choice but you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight and have me stuck at DFW for 7 hours!
0,"@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool."

1,@SouthwestAir thank you!
0,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
0,@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flights arrivals &amp; departures in Nashville as of 5pm. That and more weather headlines @ 4pm #LiveOnFOX17 #FebruaryFreezeFox17
0,"@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious ""entertainment"" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse"
0,@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
0,"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"
0,@SouthwestAir too Late Flight now
0,@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
0,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
0,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
1,"@SouthwestAir Ahah😃💕🎵 That is why
I love SW✈❗(^^)❤"
0,@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
0,@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
0,"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
1,@USAirways Haha - that will indeed be a great day!
0,@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
0,"@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again"
0,@USAirways thank you so much for asking us to pay $700 to switch to a different flight so I could spend more time with my dying nephew.
0,@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
0,@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
0,"@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH"
1,@SouthwestAir I love this airline so much! Thanks so much! The service is great! The snacks are amazing! Everything is outstanding thanks!!
0,"@SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62"", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn't very clear to me."
0,@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
0,@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
0,"@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback."
0,@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
0,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
1,"@JetBlue, was far less painful than what was coming from Avis.  💙"
0,@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
0,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
0,@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
0,@JetBlue i am here - what is your resolution?
0,@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
0,"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
1,@JetBlue its a wonderful thing!
0,@USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight.
0,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
0,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
0,@united - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here's hoping they arrive
1,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
1,"@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed."
0,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
1,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
0,@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
1,@AmericanAir excellent!  Love you guys!  If it is first class I'll hug ya'll!  See you shortly!
0,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
0,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
0,@USAirways so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding!
1,@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
1,"@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks."
0,@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
0,"@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!"
0,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
0,"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
0,@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy
0,@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
1,@SouthwestAir Incredible view! I had a smooth flight both ways even tho there was turbulence. Your pilots ROCK! http://t.co/3nsUSfSBPv
0,@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
0,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines"
0,"@SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said ""well i was Late Flight"""
0,@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
1,@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! 😁
0,@JetBlue I just booked a flight with you guys. I'm reconsidering that decision now after reading this tweet.
0,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
0,"@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain"
0,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
0,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
0,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0,@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
0,"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
0,@united you're terrible.
0,@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
0,@AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
0,"@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??"
0,"@USAirways flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt...
Is everything ok?"
0,@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
0,@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
0,@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
0,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0,@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
0,@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
0,@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
1,@SouthwestAir always when I fly SW. #loyalRRmember
0,"@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever"
1,@united @parryaftab done thnx
1,@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ❤❤
0,@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
0,"@SouthwestAir I love you guys, but even Comcast has a better phone help system. A simple callback system would fix most of the problem..."
0,@USAirways flight #3739 leaving CVG. Gate agent had no computer and counted passengers on paper. I feel safe.
0,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
0,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
0,"@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2"
0,@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
0,@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
1,"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
0,"@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?"
0,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
1,"@VirginAmerica View of downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign, and beyond that rain in the mountains! http://t.co/Dw5nf0ibtr"
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
0,@SouthwestAir we are having a real issue trying to get thru to you.  On hold for 2 hours &amp; got disconnected!  Please help!
0,"@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail"
0,@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
0,@USAirways you need to figure your scheduling out! #worstflightexperienceever #getmehome
0,"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
0,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
0,"@SouthwestAir What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 😑"
0,@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM
1,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
0,@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
0,"@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah ""I"" got it rebooked"
0,@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
0,@AmericanAir really
0,@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
1,@JetBlue you bet:)
0,@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
0,"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
1,@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
0,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
0,@USAirways really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher.
1,@AmericanAir exceptional customer service from AA - my misplaced item was waiting for me at checkin followed by a smooth flight. Thank you!
0,@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
0,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
0,@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
0,"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
0,@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
0,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
1,@VirginAmerica Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
0,@USAirways  but have to return car to clt can I skip my flgjt back tonight from gso to clt and pick up at clt to fll I was told yes
1,@USAirways great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam
0,@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
1,@VirginAmerica Very nicely done. 👏
0,@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag
0,"@JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best."
0,"@AmericanAir you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The ""status"" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted."
0,"@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free ""This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry"" tequila shots?"
0,@JetBlue App still saying I can't DM you...
0,@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
0,@USAirways So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?!
1,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0,@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
0,@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
0,"@USAirways My family, friends and colleagues will NEVER  fly USAir again. Bad weather happens. The good airlines seem to communicate better."
0,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
0,@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
1,"@USAirways thx 4 replying. After trying 2 get thru many times, &amp; v-mail or people hanging up on, us we talked 2 tech...cont'd"
0,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
0,@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
0,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
1,"@USAirways TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3"
0,@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
0,@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
0,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
1,"@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails"
0,@united it won't help...been there done that.
1,@SouthwestAir AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest
0,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
0,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
0,@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
0,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
0,@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
0,"@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?"
0,@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
0,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
0,@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
1,@JetBlue shows us their sense of humor with these tongue-in-cheek flight etiquette videos: http://t.co/GGuAA1JvDF
1,@AmericanAir great customer service thanks
1,@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
0,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
0,@SouthwestAir can you provide direct assistance? My colleague and I cannot re-book b/c the ticket was booked via a corporate account. #help
0,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
0,@SouthwestAir yep after two hours and thirty minutes
0,@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
1,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
0,"@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls"
0,@JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
1,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
0,@USAirways this is how concerned your gate attendants at C26 are this afternoon. #nocommunication #nocrew http://t.co/hFjYN2vtVj
0,"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"
0,@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
0,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
0,@AmericanAir cannot provide us alternative flight until 36 hours Late Flightr ruining our trip! #Cancelled Flightled #angry #problems #ruined.
0,@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
0,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable

0,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
0,@USAirways I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial?
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
0,@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
0,@SouthwestAir I did but it only shows one flight one way. When I try to go to the home page and book roundtrip there's nothing available :(
1,“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
0,"@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered ""perks"" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, ""NO."" #thenewamerican"
0,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0,@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
0,@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness
0,@united Classic
0,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
1,"@SouthwestAir I love imagine dragons o flipping much, pls #DestinationDragons"
0,@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
1,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
0,@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
1,@SouthwestAir thanks I think we've got it figured out
0,@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
0,@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
0,"@AmericanAir

0,@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
0,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
1,@USAirways thanks to the whole team for an on-time flight despite inclement weather http://t.co/eQePkkPSXM
1,@SouthwestAir A wonderfully nice agent in Austin helped us out. Wish I remembered her name to give proper kudos.
0,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
0,@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
0,@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
0,@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!
0,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
1,@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
0,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to

0,@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
1,@united thanks
0,@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
0,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
0,@SouthwestAir- I called @united and they solved the flight Cancelled Flightlation issue in 15minutes. May be ask them how to do it? #getmorehands

0,"@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!"
0,@USAirways The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call?
0,@USAirways help im falling out of one of your planes
0,@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
1,"@JetBlue If you ""follow"" me, I will be able to DM you.  Thanks."
0,@USAirways 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh]
0,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
0,"@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag"

0,@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
0,@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
0,. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it
0,@USAirways Looks like I'm already delayed and will miss my connecting flight in Philadelphia. Do you un-delay your flights?
0,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
0,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
0,@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Ur60Un86gy
0,@SouthwestAir please please please answer the phone. . .
0,@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
0,@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
0,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
1,@AmericanAir keep up the good work.  Got me to my destination safe and on time today
0,@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
0,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
0,"@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again."
1,Thank U 😘 “@JetBlue: @ItsLaLoca But of course! Safety is always 1st!  We'll make sure to handle her with CARE and LOVE!  :)”
0,@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!

1,"@USAirways Got it, thanks!"
0,@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
0,@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
1,@United  great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! Looking forward to my global first class suite!
1,@JetBlue thank you for being jetblue and not jetgreen or jetred. blue is my favorite color! and jet blue makes it better :)
0,@usairways hopefully your crappy service improves as u become @americanairlines #angryairtravel #winterstorm

0,@SouthwestAir Flight 2646.  Four hours in the plane on the ground at BWI.
0,@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
0,@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
0,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
0,"@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed"
0,@JetBlue yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it's your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially
0,"@USAirways Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told "" I don't feel like dealing with it"" 😒"
0,@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
0,@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
0,"@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero."
1,@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed
0,@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
0,.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
0,@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
0,@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
0,@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
0,@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
0,@USAirways WORST customer service ever!!!
0,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
0,@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
0,"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
0,@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
0,@united your customer service is crap.
0,@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
0,@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
1,"@SouthwestAir Great flight yesterday from MSY to AUS!! Thank you for such great safety,service and beautiful skies!! http://t.co/X1EqYAHfvZ"
0,@AmericanAir I remained on hold for 2 hrs to resolve my flight schedule &amp; your system hung up on me. #unhappycustomer
0,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
0,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
1,@SouthwestAir @MichaelBColeman - thanks for making new direct flight to San Francisco.
1,@SouthwestAir finally!
0,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
1,"@VirginAmerica , am I dreaming? Did you really just open up a route between Dallas and Austin?! And does this mean Houston might be next?"
0,"@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!"
1,@united thanks for leaving our 3 year old in his own row flight 360 LAX-IAD
0,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
0,@SouthwestAir is that the same reliable system couldn't find my info and then said it refund my credit card ?
1,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
0,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
1,"@JetBlue be flying soon to NYC on your airline, of all airlines I've flown you're still #1 to me 😊😊😊✈️✈️✈️"
1,@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
0,"@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25"
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..
1,Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
0,@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
0,"@USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me!"
1,@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
0,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
0,@united hilarious
0,@AmericanAir Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... http://t.co/DQnn0Rf1V8
0,"@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625"
0,@SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today?
0,@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
0,@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
0,@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
0,@USAirways terrible service
1,@JetBlue No worries. Time flew in the terminal and now we're taking off. Thanks again!
0,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
0,@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
0,@USAirways how about an update with real information?still waiting on Tarmac in Philadelphia.
0,@SouthwestAir got a text my flight was Cancelled Flightled! Now what do I do :/?? Help please!!!
0,@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
0,@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
1,@JetBlue thanks
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir seriously with all the service issues you are having right now this is what you decide to tweet?? Unbelievable
0,@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
0,"@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear"
0,We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
0,@AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn't a problem.
0,@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver member😒
0,@AmericanAir I got rebooked on on us airways by you guys but the flight I got won't work. Any help would be appreciated.
0,@USAirways 4 hrs and counting today alone... like I don't have other things to accomplish today than to just keep holding!!!
0,"@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O"
0,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
0,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
0,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
0,@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
0,"@USAirways 167 minutes?  ""Im not trained in that"". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?"
0,@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
0,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
0,@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
0,@SouthwestAir huge problem with someone whose ticket was Cancelled Flighted mid trip. Can you DM?
0,@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
1,@SouthwestAir shhhh i don't want something else to steal our deal😉
0,@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
0,@SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
0,@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
0,@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
0,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
0,@AmericanAir 1416 Cancelled Flightled? Can't get out for two days? No explanation?
0,@JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
0,@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
0,@USAirways he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted
0,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
0,"@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am"
0,@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
0,@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
0,"@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care"
1,@SouthwestAir has the smoooothest flight attendants. #SouthwestSmoothie http://t.co/Vr9k180LaI
0,@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.
0,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
0,"@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?"
0,"@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?"
1,@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you 😄
0,@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
1,@JetBlue thanks so much. Can't wait to fly with you guys :)
0,@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?

0,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
1,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
1,@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
0,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."

0,.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
0,Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
0,@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.
0,@USAirways I left an item on plane BOS-PHL on Friday.  I've called PHL US Airways # &amp; left 6 msgs. No return call what to do at this point.

0,@USAirways no your not!
0,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
0,"@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?

Y have i had no correspondence"
0,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
0,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
1,@JetBlue Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #GoPatriots!
0,@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
0,@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
0,"@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected"
1,@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
1,@JetBlue sounds great! Thank you!! :)
1,@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
1,@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
0,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
0,@JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
0,@JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢
0,@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
0,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
0,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
0,"@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks"
1,So relieved I'm flying @JetBlue after listening to everyone at the neighboring gate bitch about Spirit. My airline's better than yours.
0,"@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft"
0,@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
1,@JetBlue your blue helped bring out the color of my eyes. And I promise I didn't eat all the free snacks.

0,@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace

1,@SouthwestAir Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston.

1,@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
0,@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
1,@JetBlue okay. The new screens are laptop-large &amp; real nice &amp; the wifi is appreciated. Thanks god for this tiny lil man in the middle seat.
0,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected"
0,@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead

0,"@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|"
0,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
0,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
0,@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
0,.@JetBlue i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum.
0,@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
1,@SouthwestAir have sent you a DM with the details. Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
0,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK

0,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
0,"@SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey"
0,@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
0,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
0,"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled."
0,@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
0,"@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!"

0,@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
0,"@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another ""go-to"" airliner"

1,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
0,@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
0,"@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround"
1,@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
0,@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone  ratchet airway!. ......
1,@SouthwestAir Well plane arrived pretty much on time and it's 68 degrees on the ground in Texas. Not much to complain about.
0,@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕
0,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
0,@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
0,"@AmericanAir Define ""sincerely"". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media."
0,@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
0,@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
0,@USAirways pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal!
0,"@AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using ""weather"""
0,@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
1,@SouthwestAir just got mine..now where to go??
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
0,@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
0,@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
0,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
0,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
1,@JetBlue You definitely will!
0,@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
0,"@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch"

0,@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
1,@JetBlue u cool
1,@JetBlue The Magic eight ball has never steered me wrong  :)
0,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
0,@united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
0,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
0,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"
1,"@JetBlue We had 2 great flights into and out of the Bahamas, even during the bad weather in the northeast, thanks for the great service!!!"
0,@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
0,@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
0,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
0,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
0,@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
0,"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""

0,@USAirways Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
0,"@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard ""your bag has not been located."" 😩"
0,@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.

1,@JetBlue thanks for a speedy flight time recovery.
0,@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.

0,@SouthwestAir yeah bruh its bool y'all niggaz just need to hire some more workers or something cause next time imma be forced ta disrespect.

0,@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
0,@USAirways got off stand by list and on earlier flight to DCA. What is the status of my checked bag? Was supposed to be on #4047 thanks
0,@USAirways nope not yet...
0,@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
0,@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
0,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0,@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
0,@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
0,"@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should"
0,Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue
0,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
0,@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
0,"Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue"
0,"@jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting ""We are not able to sign you in"" msg."
0,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
0,@AmericanAir my flight 1337 is Cancelled Flightled.  Can you let me know what my new flight info is?
0,@SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it's just on the nxt flight up. I've got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I'll just turn my sweatshirt inside out
0,@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
0,@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
0,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
0,"@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped"
0,@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
1,"@JetBlue awesome, thanks! on hold now."
0,@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
0,@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
0,"@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?"
0,@SouthwestAir I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours.
0,@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
0,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
1,@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
0,"@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime"
0,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
0,@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
1,@SouthwestAir yes I was everything worked out great
0,@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
1,@JetBlue he just went above and beyond to be helpful
0,@SouthwestAir I need to request a refund on my flight that was Cancelled Flightled this morning due to the weather.
1,@SouthwestAir yes please
1,"@JetBlue FYI, I'm onboard #616 comfortably travelling to JFK, seat was no problem as you said. Thanks for making flying more civilized!"
0,@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
0,@USAirways yesterday we were delayed for SIX hours w/lil to NO explanation we paid LOTS of $$ 2 fly w/u &amp; this is how u treat ur customers?
0,@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.
0,@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
0,@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
0,@USAirways i have been trying ALL WEEK to book a multi city award trip (can't book online) I'm told to call back some other time. What?!?
0,@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
0,@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!

0,@USAirways you guys straight up suck ass
0,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
0,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
0,@SouthwestAir my wife is trying to get a group of clients to their destination and just got disconnected after2 hours holding. Help.
0,"@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed."
1,@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
0,@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
1,@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
0,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.

0,"@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls"
0,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
0,@AmericanAir not sure why I would bother when the agent at the airport didnt help &amp; nobody on phone would. Ticket Cancelled Flightled for no reason.
0,@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
0,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
0,@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
1,@SouthwestAir thanks for the follow up. So glad to get my bag back.
0,@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine

0,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
0,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
0,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.

0,@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
1,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine well deserved!
0,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0,@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .

0,@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography

0,@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks

0,"@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you."

0,@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...

1,@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)
0,@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 😒
0,@AmericanAir understand waiting 2+ hours for callback on the exec plat line but when call dropped the agent could at least try again
0,@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
0,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
1,@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
0,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
0,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
0,"@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board"
0,"@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site."
0,@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
1,@SouthwestAir you are lucky to have people like Annamarie and Norris at BWI. I hope they get recognized for excellent cust. service
0,"@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire"
1,@JetBlue Was nice to see your Veterans Advantage Program at the gate on Sunday @ MCO.Keep up the good work at  JetBlue
0,"@USAirways very disappointed I wasn't ""allowed"" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning."
0,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
0,@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
0,@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
0,"@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start."
0,@SouthwestAir a week after Valentines day..not feeling the #LUV. Going on 11 hrs @BWI and don't my bags aren't even coming w me.
0,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1,"@AmericanAir yes, it says it should be deliver within 6 hours after pick up line."
0,"Sorry for unfollowing, @JetBlue"
0,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
0,@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
0,"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
0,@JetBlue that's not a answer!
1,@SouthwestAir oh my god thank you so much!!! I just sent you a DM
0,"@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar."
0,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
0,@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
0,"@AmericanAir I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems"
1,@AmericanAir awesome! Thx
0,@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
1,@JetBlue @vincenzolandino @CBarrows You take to me places @united simply can't...like non-stop to St. Lucia.
1,@JetBlue I would go anywhere JetBlue goes.
0,@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
0,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
1,@SouthwestAir makes flying for @UNO_Baseball fun! Flight crew just led the plane in singing happy birthday to one of our guys! #LuvInTheAir

0,@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
0,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.

0,@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. 😂💁
0,@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.

1,@JetBlue Thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
0,@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
0,@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
0,@USAirways Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!!
0,@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
0,@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
0,@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
1,@JetBlue i deleted that tweet because one of your wonderful employees swooped in to help--faith restored. You are one of the good ones. 👍

0,@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
0,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
0,@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house

0,@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
0,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
0,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
0,@SouthwestAir can you help me with reFlight Booking Problems? My flight was Cancelled Flighted. FWHEI6
0,@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
1,@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass
0,@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
0,@united false.
1,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
0,@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
1,@AmericanAir Just followed you.
1,@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
0,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
1,@united just sent - thank you!
0,@SouthwestAir on hold for over an hour twice?  Terrible.
0,"@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice"
0,"@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA."
0,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
0,@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
0,@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
0,"Social agencies, this is why we can't have nice things. @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/QRxz0bGbtq"
0,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
0,@united customers ✅. Customer service ❌ http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
0,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
1,@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx
0,"@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now."
0,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
0,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
0,@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
1,@JetBlue Awesome thanks! Thanks for the quick response. You guys ROCK! :)
1,@SouthwestAir had a great flight to and from Cabo last week with my family #smoothflight #frequentflyer
1,@JetBlue thank you very very much!! 💙💙
1,@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
0,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
0,"@SouthwestAir coming up on 10 hrs and all at the gate, not leaving and without my baggage. SWA you are my nightmare!"
0,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
0,@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
0,@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full

0,@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
0,@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.

1,"@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!"
1,@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
0,@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
0,@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
0,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
0,@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
0,@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd

0,"@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?"
0,@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
0,@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
0,"@USAirways Chairman Preferred with 518,758 lifetime miles. What is my US Air reward, no #firstclass upgrades on @AmericanAir as usual."

0,@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
1,@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp; ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay.
1,@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
0,@USAirways @JosephTReis Dont bother. They dont pick up the phone. Worst customer service going
0,@SouthwestAir 3 + hrs w/out bags being returned to us after flight 2464 Cancelled Flightled. Maybe put a couple people on it?

0,@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
0,@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
0,"@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight."
0,@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
0,@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
0,"@AmericanAir Nope, I have not been rebooked."
0,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
1,"@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!"
0,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
0,@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
0,@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail

0,@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
0,@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
0,@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
0,@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.

0,"Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."""
1,@JetBlue Thanks for the complimentary upgrade to first.  You are the best!
0,@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
0,@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!

0,@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
0,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
0,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
0,"@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight."
1,@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
0,@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
0,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
1,@JetBlue just touched down in #NewOrleans for the annual @HeinekenUSACorp national distributor conference! #livethelegend
0,@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
0,@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.

1,@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!
0,@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
0,@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
0,@AmericanAir How do I check? Reservation for Joe Watson and Kelsey Jennings. We were on hold for 2 hours. Waiting for call back now. ETA?

1,@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! 😁
1,@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
0,@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
0,"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk"" {sees line ~45 people deep}"
0,"@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?"
0,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0,"@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit."
0,@AmericanAir they did tell that our luggage stayed inside the plane ! Look this video http://t.co/YokkHHQcMP
0,@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
0,@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
0,@USAirways any tips on getting a hotel that your airline won't get for any of us even though we were told that we'd make our flight?
0,“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
0,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
0,@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
0,.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
0,@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
0,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
1,@USAirways — I had exceptional service on flight #403 from IND to PHX!!
0,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
0,@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
0,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
0,@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
0,@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
0,"@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled"
0,@USAirways is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182
0,@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
0,"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
0,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
1,@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
0,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
0,@AmericanAir @AmericanAir how do you expect to do that?
0,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
0,@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
0,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
0,#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
0,"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
0,"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
0,"@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv."
0,@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
0,@SouthwestAir jumped the gun a little Cancelled Flighting our flights? No other airline is Cancelled Flighting out of Louisville. You're ruining my vacation.
0,"@usairways trick for getting into your hold queue?  I've been calling since Thursday and keep getting the ""call back Late Flightr"" message"
0,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
0,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
1,@SouthwestAir Southwest Airline is THE way to go!

0,@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
0,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
1,"@VirginAmerica classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz"

1,@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
0,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
0,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
0,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
0,"@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again."
0,@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
0,@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
1,"@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done"

1,@united that's fine. I'll take them.
0,@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
0,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..

0,"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"

0,@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
0,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
0,"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."
0,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
0,@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
0,"@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho."

0,@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
0,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
0,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
0,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
0,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
0,@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...

0,@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
0,@SouthwestAir I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
0,@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
0,@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
0,@united the worst customer service in Denver.
0,@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
1,@SouthwestAir so happy that you can finally put your #southwestairlines boarding pass into passbook! Makes life so much easier ✈️

1,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
1,@JetBlue thanks!!
0,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
0,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
0,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.

0,"@SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice"
0,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
0,"@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]"

0,@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.

0,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0,@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
0,@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
0,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
0,@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
0,@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
0,@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous

0,@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
1,@SouthwestAir Thank u Thank u Thank u for coming through for us! I sincerely didn't think it would happen. &lt;3 #SWA #THANKYOU
0,@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.
0,@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/

0,@SouthwestAir   Where the heck are the bags for Chicago 408. It has been an hour
0,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
0,"@VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???"
0,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0,@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
0,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"

0,@united still waiting
0,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
0,@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
1,@JetBlue was just at T5 a little over a month ago. @JetBlue you guys are great thanks for everything!
0,@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.

0,"@AmericanAir flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?"
1,"@JetBlue she was a phone agent, pls do! Peggy was pleasant, informative and delivered. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
0,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
0,@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
0,@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
0,@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
0,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
0,@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
0,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
