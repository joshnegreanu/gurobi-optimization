0,"@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service"
0,"@USAirways his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money"

0,@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
0,@USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab
0,"@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"""
0,@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?
0,"@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation."
0,"@JetBlue this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat?"
0,@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
1,@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.
1,"@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?"
0,@virginamerica What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
0,@SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
0,@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
0,"@united yep—used that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, “thank you for submitting your request”"
0,"@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again."
0,@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
0,@SouthwestAir an entire flight of luggage missing at #dca.  Over an hour and nobody knows anything.
0,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
0,"@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing."
0,@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
0,@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
1,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
0,@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
0,"@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning."
0,@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
0,@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
0,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
0,"@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours."
0,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
0,@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
0,@AmericanAir @tcunningham10 please call us back to rebook. 7403607771 we can't through!!!!! We need to get to columbus!!!!
0,@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
0,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
0,"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
1,"@USAirways @AmericanAir Thank you for a couple of easy, hassle free flights today, professional and friendly staff made everything easy!"
0,"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
0,@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
0,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
0,@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
0,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0,@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
0,@USAirways I really appreciate there not being an easy way to get another flight when mine has been delayed over 2hrs for mechanical reasons
0,@USAirways like they will call me? I'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering...

0,"@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel"
0,"@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time."
0,@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
0,@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
1,"@SouthwestAir in flight wifi + @TMobile wifi calling makes for the best combination. Who doesn't love texting 40,000 feet in the air :D"
0,@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.

1,@VirginAmerica ok! first time flying with you tonight :)
1,@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
0,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
1,"“@JetBlue: @jannasaurusrex Thanks for the kind words, Janna! #WeAppreciateYou #TrueBlue” and now I'M feeling like a boss #jetbluefame"
0,"@AmericanAir Call me Chairman, or call me Emerald. After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer."
0,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
0,@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
0,"@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue"
0,"@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?"
0,@SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?
0,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir @GMA could not have had a worse airline experience. Rude, unhelpful, got yelled at😳. @JetBlue need your help"

0,@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
0,"@JetBlue honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/"
0,@JetBlue figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers
0,"@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?"
0,.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2

0,@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!

0,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."

0,@VirginAmerica What is the reason  for the delay of the departure of VX 413 from JFK this afternoon?
0,@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
0,@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
1,@JetBlue haha. TY. Do you know what time that lane opens at Logan?
0,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
0,@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
0,@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
0,"@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers."
1,@SouthwestAir you guys are so amazing for sending people to meet Imagine Dragons #DestinationDragons 😋
0,@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain

1,@united They finally gave in a let him on. After they threatened to send him back to Vegas on coach. Thnx.
0,"@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
0,@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
0,@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.

0,Hey @AmericanAir why automated call me and then hang up at 4:45 am!?! And why can't I reschedule Cancelled Flighted flights via web!?! Come on!!!
0,@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
0,"@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?"
0,@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
0,@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
0,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
0,@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
1,@JetBlue toss this ticket...it's great PR and I'm sure every college student following me will be willing to rock out wit too 👀👀
0,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
0,@JetBlue WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO

0,"@AmericanAir still no reply to my email sent on 11th February. Even sent an email asking for acknowledgment that's it been recieved, nothing"
0,@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
0,@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
0,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
0,@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
0,"@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!"
1,"@SouthwestAir I tweeted several times last week about flight info during storm, always a timely tweet back.  Thx! 😄"
0,"@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful."
0,@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.

0,"@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded."
0,"@AmericanAir you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need"
0,"@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again."
0,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
0,@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
0,"@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest."

1,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it

0,@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
0,@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
0,@AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL.
0,@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
1,@JetBlue had a great flight to Orlando from Hartford a few weeks ago! Was great to get out on time and arrive early!
0,@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
0,@JetBlue I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
0,"@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕"

0,@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
0,@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
0,@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
0,"@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would ""eventually get her bag"" completely unacceptable"
0,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
0,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
1,@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
0,“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience*

1,@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!

1,"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
0,@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
0,@SouthwestAir @challemann flying to LGA in the dead of winter? #jvstatus EWR &amp; JFK is always the intelligent option.
1,@VirginAmerica cutest salt and pepper shaker ever. Just when I think you guys can't get any better you just do! http://t.co/vC6Keulg2J

1,@united Thanks for the update.
0,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
0,@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
1,@SouthwestAir so glad u guys do business w/ more class than UR competitors @SpiritAirlines 😏

0,@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
0,"@USAirways: u didn't bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats!"

1,@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
1,@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.

0,"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
0,@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)

0,"@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for ""weather"" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?"
0,"@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour"
0,@JetBlue Need your help. I'm moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won't seem to let me. Am I missing something?
0,@USAirways - on hold 45 minutes trying to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight. Really?
1,"@SouthwestAir you guys rock! So easy, quick, and affordable to change my flight. #bestairlineever #neverchange"
0,@SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson
0,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
0,@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
0,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
0,@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
0,@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
1,@JetBlue u the real MVP http://t.co/jWL26G6lRw
0,@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
0,@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
0,@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
0,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
0,@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
0,@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
0,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
0,@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.
0,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
1,@AmericanAir Thanks! He is.
1,@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?
0,"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
0,@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
0,@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
0,@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
1,@JetBlue thank you
0,@AmericanAir it doesn't allow me to hold. That's the problem.
0,@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.
0,@SouthwestAir no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
0,@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
0,@united is by far the worst airline ever 😡😡
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
0,"@USAirways your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me!"
0,@JetBlue *cough* #awkward!
0,@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
0,@united go to hell
0,@SouthwestAir @dultch97 that's horse radish 😤🐴
0,@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
0,@SouthwestAir  over 15 minutes without talking to a human at what point would you recommend I call @AmericanAir http://t.co/ysqbVq6Mgb
0,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
0,@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.
1,"@AmericanAir appreciate update. Have also appreciated our pilots effort to explain to us just now. Accurate, authoritative comms is vital."
0,@SouthwestAir prove it
0,"Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals"
0,"@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒"
0,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
0,@SouthwestAir Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
0,@USAirways once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please
1,@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.
0,@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
0,@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
0,@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
0,"@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!"
0,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
0,@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
0,"@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT"
1,@SouthwestAir rules.
0,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
0,@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
1,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
0,@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
0,"@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage"
0,@united why do you bother surveying me!
0,"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
1,@JetBlue Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC!
1,@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
0,@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
1,@JetBlue my family and I are excited to see you too😊😊
0,@USAirways won't waive $200 fee due to #neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic #waivethefee
0,"@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral."
0,@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
0,"@USAirways status shows ""delayed"" it was just ""waiting for takeoff"" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD"
0,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
1,@united look at this beauty 😉 dc 10 united airlines 😉 http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
1,@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congrats!
0,@united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
1,@JetBlue just mine sadly.. But yea the fly fi is awesome
0,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
0,@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention
0,@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
0,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
0,@USAirways How do I get through?
0,@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
0,@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
0,@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
0,@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?
0,"@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!"
0,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
0,".@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue."
0,@USAirways Strike Three!!! You guys suck!!!
0,@USAirways 4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!!
0,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
1,@JetBlue: So excited to hear about your move towards international travel from Long Beach Airport!
0,@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
0,@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
1,@SouthwestAir shout out to the flight #4386 crew for taking amazing care of us on our double down flight! #thankyou
0,@USAirways cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before
0,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
1,@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
0,@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
1,@SouthwestAir DeLacy P is a compassionate professional! Despite the flight challenges she made passengers feel like priorities!!🌟🌟
0,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
0,@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
0,"@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy"
0,@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
0,@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
0,@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
0,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
1,@VirginAmerica I see what you did there ;)
0,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
0,@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
1,@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!💺✈️ Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
0,@JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.
0,@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
1,@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
0,@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
0,@SouthwestAir Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN
0,.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines
0,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
0,@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
0,@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
0,@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
0,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
0,@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
0,@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?

1,@SouthwestAir Customer Centricity is knowing people #ANAMarketers
0,"@SouthwestAir I have sent the DM, should I continue to wait on hold with a rep, or will you be servicing me here?"
0,@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
0,"@SouthwestAir no, thanks. I think we have it straight!"
0,@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
0,"@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?"
0,@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
0,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
0,@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
0,@USAirways 3hr30min right now...  any end in sight?
0,@SouthwestAir FIND A WAY TO Cancelled Flight FLIGHT 310!!!!!!!
0,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
1,@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
0,@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
0,@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
0,@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
1,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
1,@JetBlue good to hear. Thx for being responsive.
0,"@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"
0,@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
0,"@AmericanAir Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because ""no weather advisory.""Really!"
1,@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
1,"@JetBlue why yes, yes it does!!!!  Great trip down!! Thanks for the lift!!!!"
0,@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
0,@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
0,".@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it."
0,@USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply.
0,@USAirways NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on.
1,@USAirways Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!!
0,@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
0,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
0,@SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag
0,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
0,@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
0,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
1,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
0,@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
1,"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
0,“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vw2v8GVnGq” 😐😑
0,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
0,@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
0,@USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time
1,@SouthwestAir @AARP #tfw1 Appreciate the tweet back - It was unexpected.
0,"Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways"
0,"@JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security"
1,"@JetBlue Also, thanks for your prompt replies. I'm really impressed--and you're not just brushing me off. Much appreciated!"
0,"@USAirways disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home"
1,@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the Atlanta show ♥️
0,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
0,"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
0,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
0,@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
1,@SouthwestAir thx. Make it right. Help Meagan Fouty Brancato fl#2771 dfw gate 4 preboard w/kids - b4 group A please. Please.
0,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
0,@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
0,@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
0,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
0,@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
0,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
0,@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
0,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
1,@SouthwestAir DM sent.  Thank you.
0,@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
1,@SouthwestAir is making dreams come true with their #DestinationDragons scavenger hunt! You can win a chance to see Imagine Dragons! Go!
0,@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
0,@USAirways needs to hire more people http://t.co/3LPVFhKy2F
0,"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"
0,"@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!"
0,@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
0,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
0,@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
0,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
0,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
0,.@USAirways Have you just given up?
1,Eliza &amp; I cheated on u @AmericanAir with @AirTahitiNui &amp; it was a lovely flight. But we'll be back! Lots!
1,@JetBlue incredible PR team. 👏👏👏👏
1,@USAirways i hope i get the opportunity to join the team with this job opening!
1,@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
0,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
0,"@USAirways you can't control the weather but you CAN control your systems, processes, people and attitudes. #anotherfail"
0,@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
0,"@USAirways is it policy to tell customers ""We can't help you?"" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable"
1,"@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection."
0,@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
0,@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
1,"@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!"
0,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
0,@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
1,@SouthwestAir you guys are awesome... #dontchangeathing #luv
0,"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"
0,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
1,@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
0,"@JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed."
0,@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
0,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
1,@SouthwestAir good to be back. See you all again in several weeks.
1,I know you have a lot of baggage... But i want you to know i really enjoyed being inside you. @JetBlue #Jetbae
0,@USAirways fuck you.
0,@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
1,@VirginAmerica has the most INCREDIBLE customer service I've ever experienced! So refreshing!
0,@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
0,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
0,@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
0,@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
0,@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
0,@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
0,@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
0,@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
0,Jet BOOOO 🍅🍅🍅🍅 RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/0WbJAWx7xD
0,@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
0,@SouthwestAir baggage claim has already changed 2x...most recent had 3 bags come out and then stop...claim team has no idea what's going on
0,@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
0,@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
0,@USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....
0,@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
0,@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
0,@SouthwestAir extremely #disappointed with poor the customer service provided after Cancelled Flighting my flight today! #unprofessional
1,@united Ok thank again for your help!
0,@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
0,@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
0,@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
0,@AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
0,@USAirways 2nd plane forced to get off due to mech and wait for 3rd need housing and meals in STT need help b4 we arrive at STT please
0,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
0,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
0,@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!

0,@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
0,@USAirways I tried calling for yet another delayed flight and was told the phone line couldn't handle the volume and was hung up on. Twice.
1,.@SouthwestAir you've got a mess here at DTW but your staff is doing great.

1,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
0,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?

0,@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
0,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
0,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
0,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
0,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
0,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
0,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
0,@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
0,@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
0,@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
0,"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"

0,@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
0,@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
0,"@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight."
0,@JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
0,@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
